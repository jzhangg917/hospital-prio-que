## Introduction
This project simulates an emergency room's patient management system using a priority queue. Patients are admitted based on their medical urgency and treated accordingly. The priority queue ensures efficient patient handling in emergency scenarios.

## Getting Started
To run the simulation, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emergency-room-simulation.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd emergency-room-simulation`
3. Run the simulation: `python main.py`

## Project Structure
- `main.py`: The main script to run the simulation.
- `priority_queue.py`: Contains the implementation of the priority queue data structure.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Code Explanation
The simulation uses a priority queue to manage patients' admission and treatment. Patients are objects with attributes like name, condition, and priority. The priority queue ensures that patients with higher medical urgency are treated first.

## Technologies Used
- Python

## Features
- Patient admission based on medical urgency.
- Treatment of patients based on priority.
- Simulation of an emergency room scenario.

## Usage
Follow the steps in the "Getting Started" section to run the simulation. Sample outputs and patient treatment scenarios will be displayed.
