## Introduction

In emergency situations, managing patients efficiently is crucial. This simulation project offers an interactive way to understand how a priority queue can optimize patient admission and treatment. The system is designed to ensure that patients with higher medical urgency are treated promptly, potentially saving lives.

## Features

- **Priority Queue Management:** Patients are handled using a priority queue, ensuring that urgent cases receive immediate attention.
- **Realistic Simulation:** The simulation emulates real-world hospital scenarios, including patient admission and treatment.
- **Code Example:** The code demonstrates the implementation of a priority queue and its application in a practical use case.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emergency-room-simulation.git
    ```

2. **Install matplotlab:**

    ```
    pip install matplotlib
    ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
